How to specify using magic methods.

Magic methods can be used under class components. To be made available for use in perfume functional types.

Magic methods extend method functionality similar to decorators.

```jsx
class A extends UIElement {
  template () {
    return <div>Simple Text</div>
  }

  [CLICK('$el')] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }
}

```

If you use a magic method, you can create a template more easily.

## Checker

Magic methods have some special features.

##### How to use Checkers
```jsx

import {CLICK, ALT, SHIFT, CONTROL, META} from "@elf-framework/sapa";

class A extends UIElement {
  [CLICK('$el') + ALT] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }

  [CLICK('$el') + SHIFT] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }

  [CLICK('$el') + CONTROL] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }

  [CLICK('$el') + META] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }
}
  
```

#### How to sum Checkers 

```jsx
class A extends UIElement {
  [CLICK('$el') + ALT + SHIFT] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }

  [CLICK('$el') + SHIFT + META] (nativeDomEvent) {
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }
}
  
```

#### How to run by `IF`

```jsx
class A extends UIElement {

  // check whether control key is pressed
  checkEvent(nativeDomEvent) {
    return nativeDomEvent.ctrlKey;
  }

  [CLICK('$el') + ALT + IF("checkEvent")] (nativeDomEvent) {
    // run if ctrlKey and altKey are pressed
    console.log(nativeDomEvent);
  }

}
  
```
