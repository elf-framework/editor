Let's learn the basics of Sapa.
Sapa was created to make UI creation with JavaScript easy.

To use the JS library, you need a few things. Let's find out one by one.

## 1. Import

Import the library into your project.

```js
import { start } from "@elf-framework/sapa";
```

## 2. Start


Start to rendering.

```js
start(App);

// or 

render(App);

```

### App

The App is the root component of your application.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3. Render

Render the component. 
```jsx
start(App);
```
<Alert type="info" weak={true}>
You can use <strong>render</strong> function instead of{" "}
<strong>start</strong>.
</Alert>

    start is a function that takes a Sapa component as a parameter.

### VNode

A VNode is a virtual DOM node.

```js
start(<App key="value" />)
```

### Class Component
A class component is a component that is defined in a class.

```js
class App extends UIElement {
  template() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Function Component

A function component is a component that is defined in a function.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

```
