# Contextual Help

Contextual help shows a user extra information about the state of either an adjacent component or an entire view. It explains a high-level topic about an experience and can point users to more information elsewhere.

<MainView />

## Options

### Icon

<OptionsView />

&nbsp;

Contextual help can be used to display two types of supplementary
content in an experience: in-line information (the info icon) or help
and resources to learn more (the help icon).

### Popover placement

<PlacementView />

&nbsp;

A popover is positioned in relation to its source. The placement
property values are the following:

- top
- top-left
- top-right
- bottom
- bottom-left
- bottom-right
- left
- left-top
- left-bottom
- right
- right-top
- right-bottom

The default placement value is at the top.
