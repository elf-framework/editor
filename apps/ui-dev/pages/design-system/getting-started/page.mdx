# {title}


This project is inspired by [spectrum.adobe.com/](https://spectrum.adobe.com/)

ELF basically manages design in two forms to make UI.

* Design Tokens 
* Design System 
* UI Component (Sapa based)


# Design Tokens

Design token manages various basic elements such as color, border, and padding, which are basic elements of design.


## Install 

```shell
npm install @elf-framework/design-tokens
```


## Import 

### JSON data
```jsx
// json 
import tokens from "@elf-framework/design-tokens/tokens.json";

console.log(tokens.spacing.size.lg);
```

### CSS variable

```css
@import "@elf-framework/design-tokens/tokens.css";

background-color: var(--color-gray-0);
```

### CSS Class  

```css
@import "@elf-framework/design-tokens/style.css";
```

```html
<div class="gap-16">Simple Text</div>
```

# Design System

The design system uses the design token to create a basic structure for making ui components.

## Install 

```shell
npm install @elf-framework/design-system
```

## Import 

### ESM Mode
```jsx
import "@elf-framework/design-system/style.css";
```

# UI Component (Sapa based)

The UI component uses the design system to create a `sapa` implementation that can actually be used.

## Install 

```shell
npm install @elf-framework/ui
```

## Import

### ESM Mode
```jsx
import {Button} from "@elf-framework/ui";
```
